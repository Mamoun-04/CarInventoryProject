# Car Inventory Project ðŸš—

This is a Java-based car inventory management system.  
Right now, it lets you:  
- Add cars to the inventory  
- Remove cars by VIN  
- Search cars by make, model, year, or price  
- Display the full inventory  

---

## Next Steps
This project is just the foundation. The plan is to expand it into a more complete dealership system. Some upcoming features include:  
- A **Salesperson object** to represent staff managing and selling cars.  
- A **sell endpoint/method** to record when a car is sold.  
- A **sales log (e.g. a sheet or file)** to track sales history with details like VIN, price, customer, and salesperson.  
- More complex reporting features to analyze inventory and sales.  

The goal is to gradually build this into real dealership software with more detail, functionality, and persistence.
